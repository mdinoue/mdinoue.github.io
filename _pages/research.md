***Digging Deep: Modeling Cap and Trade Policies for Groundwater Management***

**BA Honors Thesis**

 Abstract: Excessive pumping of groundwater has become a greater issue over the years.
 Previous economic literature on the topic has resulted in the underestimation of the cost
 of groundwater pumping due to a lack of integration with an accurate hydrological model.
 As researchers and policymakers alike have come to understand the large externality
 posed by over-pumping, various countries and regions with a history of water insecurity
 have tried implementing mechanisms meant to address this unsustainable overdraft.
 This paper then aims to comprehensively research the various policies being proposed
 as well as analyze the different asymmetrical considerations in creating a groundwater
 market. Furthermore, this paper also introduces a groundwater exchange rate system
 meant to correct overdraft in the event of asymmetries
